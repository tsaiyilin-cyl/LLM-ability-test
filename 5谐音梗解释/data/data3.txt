Shalley和同事说："我发现五角大楼附近的披萨店可以反应政府是否忙碌"。同事说："Surely,you can't be serious"，Shalley说："我没开玩笑"，然后瞪了同事一眼："还有，我不叫Shirley"
En:
Shalley said to his colleague, "I've noticed that the pizza places near the Pentagon can indicate how busy the government is." His colleague replied, "Surely, you can't be serious." Shalley said, "I am serious," then glared at his colleague and added, "And don't call me 'Shirley.'"
梗在于："Shirley" 和"Surely"发音接近，导致Shalley听错。
