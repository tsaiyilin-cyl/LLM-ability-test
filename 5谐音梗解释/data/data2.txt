男孩哭丧着脸跟妈妈说："我的英语老师总说我顶嘴"，妈妈问："为什么？"，男孩说："她问我数学的函数题经常求什么？而我回答"Y""

The boy said tearfully to his mother, "My English teacher always says I talk back." The mother asked, "What?" The boy replied, "She asked me what math function problems often solve for, and I answered 'Y'."
梗在于："Y"的发音和"why"一样，会让老师认为是在顶嘴
